### *Visualizing a lot of reddit comments to see the difference in the number of removed comments and all other comments*

This visualization method takes all the comments provided in the data set I used (which can be found [here]( https://www.kaggle.com/yamqwe/one-million-reddit-confessions-samplee )) and renders them randomly around two central, yet arbitrary points. In doing this, both the size and density of text blobs can be used to determine a rough ratio between actual commments and removed comments!
