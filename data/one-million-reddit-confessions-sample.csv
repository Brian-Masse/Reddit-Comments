I've always been great with children. I used to nanny and do summer camps etc. however when I got my first job in a preschool things were out of control. we were under staffed and I got EXTEREMLY overwhelmed. I was so stressed and overstimulated. Most of the children were great/ easy to work with, but these 2 problem children drove me crazy.

I engaged in power struggles with them and would sometimes be stubborn or insist on the rules rather than be gentle and allow this little overwhelmed child to have some control over their environment. I would get angry and after asking them multiple times I would just snatch the toys from their hands. I would glare at them. I used my firm voice alot.

One of them he would get angry at me and cry and I would just stare at him. Thankfully my coworker would always jump in to comfort him. I keep replaying these moments and thinking about what I could have done better. for example allowing him some space and time to transition to other activities while the other children went ahead.

It was a bad time in my life, I was not eating at the time FOR 12+ hours ( I had an ED) I had major issues in my own life and I got so overwhelmed with everything. I never got a break. but also its not fair to a little child.

For the most part I liked that place because the other children were great and I did try to do better everyday. Hearing them laugh when I organize a game for them always warmed my heart. I did put alot of effort in their activities and games. I used to buy outdoor toys from my own money.

But god that period of time was alot for me.

The memories of the bad times made me feel like shit. I feel so gross and disgusted with myself. I am embarrassed of myself. it makes me ashamed to look at my coworkers. it makes me not want to work with children ever again. I cannot stop thinking about it.

it keeps me up at night",I was horrible to children at my first preschool job,8

I stole $70 from my dad just to add money to my school lunch account in middle school, $20 from my little brother to go shopping with my friends, and about 4 years ago I wanted to go to the mall to go shopping at my favorite store. But I was broke. So I went into my sister’s room and went into her bank and grabbed $200 worth of dollar bills from her piggy bank that was shaped as a crayon. And I moved the rest of the money left around to make it look like nothing was stolen. So after I stole it and went to the mall I bought a lot of things. And my parents were suspicious of how I was able to buy all of the items seeming as to how expensive that store’s items are. Since that store always has some sale/deals going on, I used that as an excuse to how I got all of the items. Making it seem like it was cheaper than it was actually. I used the “do you want to see the receipt for proof” so they would believe me. Then when my sister was going to take her money to buy something she noticed how she was missing some money, and I was questioned about it and lied again. Using the same excuse. She was so upset and my parents were furious and I was so afraid of my dad that I did whatever I could to seem innocent. Even saying how bad I felt for her and how horrible whoever stole her money is. I want to tell her but I would rather not have to deal with that.",I stole $200 from my little sister to go shopping and lied about it,3

However, at some point, one of the owners got married to a woman who was really nasty and they decided that she should work for the family business.  While she technically had no authority, she was just bitter and mean.  She'd would make arbitrary office rules that nobody wanted to challenge because, we'll, she's an owners wife.  Being a generally unhappy person, she seemed bent on making everyone miserable.

She was also quite heavy, and it was during the liquid diet fad phase so she would pound these chocolate slimfast shakes all day long before having her one real food meal at home later.  I was a just a slim teenager trying to lift weights and get huge, so I would drink mass gainer shakes before bed (also big in the 90s).  One day after she called the staff out to the main room and screamed and spit at us for something inconsequential, my buddies and I made a plan to slowly cut more and more weight gainer powder into her slimfast cans to the point where it was 75% whatever carb-loaded chocolate sugar powder I was drinking.  She loved them.  She could also be overhead complaining about gaining weight no matter what she tried for the next several weeks.

The reason this is a confession and not a revenge, is that 15 years later she reached out to me on social media and we started chatting.  This time, she was remarried and no longer mean.  Turns out she was in a bad marriage with the owner, which she was taking out on us being a bit immature in her 20s.  I being older and wiser myself, realized that as a teenager all I saw was angry bitch, and I was the asshole.  So... confession to you all, but she'll never know.

Edit:  Changed months of complaining to weeks, we pulled this all off in a single night and ton of containers she kept at the office.  She must have gone through it after a good month, we didn't keep track of how fast she drank it, but she always seemed to have it in her hand.
